# Advent Of Code Forever

I was tired of the yearly/daily setup for Advent of Code, so I wanted to make a framework that would stand the test of time.

The goals being:
- AoCF can generate templates & pull inputs for new days automatically.
- AoCF handles multiple years.
- AoCF is architecturally simple and provides suites for input generation etc. for benchmarking
